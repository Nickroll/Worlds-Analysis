# Worlds-Analysis

This is some basic analysis and graph making done on the worlds data provided by the wonderful people over at http://oracleselixir.com/

All of the graphs images and code can be used by anyone this was done for fun and practice on data analysis. Just make sure to credit me or link to the github you got the graphs from.

The final images and grpahs are found in the individual Final directories which also include the ipynb files that I used to make the graphs. 

I'll be updating this periodically with new graphs.
